            <h1 class='longTitle'>Surviving a Residential Landslide: A Homeowner's Guide</h1>
            
            <p>In 2017 our house, backyard, and land in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA experienced a landslide. It eventually led to condemnation, insurance denial, and two years of displacement. We learned the hard way that most homeowners insurance policies don't cover landslide damage.</p>

            <p>At the time I couldn't find any internet resources for how individual homeowners could endure such a thing - logistically or psychologically. This page shares what we learned about finding a geotechnical engineer and contractor, dealing with insurance companies, navigating condemnation, legal tips, and surviving financially and emotionally when your largest asset suddenly becomes worthless.</p>

            <p>I share our experience in the hope it helps even one person. At the very least, you'll know you're not alone.</p>

            <p>Over time I hope to add some pictures/video of what the yard looked like previously. But in the still cover picture in the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI9A1ArCwIY'>video</a> below where the haybales are, the top of tarps, myself in the blue jacket, and the small patch of grass? That all used to be connected straight to the concrete and grass you see halfway down the still cover picture.</p>

            <p>One of the first warning signs was a small "crack" in the backyard in Feb 2017. And here's a month later:
            <img src="images/badscarpy_20170305.jpg" alt="Our landslide fault line at 4 weeks. Approximately 5 ft vertical." style="width:100%" class="roundedALittle">
            And then *four* days later:
            <img src="images/badscarpy_20170309.jpg" alt="Our landslide fault line at 4.5 weeks. Approximately 10 ft vertical.. Landslide" style="width:100%" class="roundedALittle"></p>

            <p>I default to the first person because it's my natural writing style. My wife was equally involved. We had incredible, tangible support from friends, family, and professionals. Many of whom gave an extraordinary amount of themselves. It really did take a village. So, I'll switch interchangeably to third person.</p> 
            
            <h2>Engineering</h2>
            <p>The problem is on a huge scale. This isn't something a few friends with buckets and shovels can fix. It's above the paygrade of many contractors. We had a few who gave ridiculous opinions such as using their skidsteer to move some dirt around. Handymen and heavy-duty landscapers alike gave it one look and knew it was not in their wheelhouse.</p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finding a geotechnical engineering firm that specializes in landslides.</li>
                    <li>The firm has to think the problem is fixable.</li>
                    <li>The company has to be willing and able to do the work. Many are not allowed by their company insurance policies to work on residential properties.</li>
                    <li>Professional engineering plans drawn and stamped.</li>
                    <li>Build and design.</li>
                    <li>Contacted dozens, 15-20 onsite...</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Insurance</h2>
            <p>It's uncommon for home insurance policies to cover landslides. We didn't know until after the fact. If you read your policy you may notice something like this in the Exclusions Section (i.e. - we ain't gonna cover that):</p>
            <img src="images/insuranceExclusion.png" alt="Insurance Exclusion" style="width:100%" class="roundedALittle">    
            <p>Our insurance company promptly denied our claim and dropped us from coverage completely. Thanks Erie Insurance! What was our largest asset was then uninsurable from any further damage.</p>

            <h2>Condemnation and Living Arrangements</h2>
            <p>A few months into the landslide our home was condemned by the city as unlivable. We lived in three other friends' homes for two years.</p>

            <h2>City, County, State, Federal Help</h2>
            <p>We had plenty of lip service and meetings with various elected officials. It did nothing and was a waste of time. It's still an angle to attempt though.</p>

            <h2>Finances</h2>
            <p>Our bank was unfazed. Mortgage payments were still due in full with no pause, hardship, or forgiveness. Thanks PNC!</p>

            <p>Our largest asset was worth at least $300,000. Overnight its worth and our equity became $0. The only recoupment was to find someone willing to buy the land for a few thousand dollars and bulldoze the house, and that's simply so we could walk away from the problem.</p>

            <p>However, walking away not unscathed because with all equity vanished and a condemned, unlivable, unfixable property the usual course of action is to declare bankruptcy and start over - not in a good way. We were terrified because we loved our street, our neighbors, our neighborhood, our house. We worried we would never be able to afford the same quality again and would have to move somewhere far away and undesirable.</p>

            <h2>Fundraising</h2>
            <p>Dear friends organized an in-person fundraiser and started a YouCaring fundraising site (later bought by GoFundMe). We were fortunate and privileged to be loved on in such a tangible way. We were given ~$40,000(!) which helped us to miraculously break even. It mostly went to lawyer fees.</p>

            <h2>Life Continues</h2>
            <p>My wife and I both worked full-time. We had two kids in grade school and one in daycare. Life doesn't stop. All the regular adulting and logistics still have to happen.</p>

            <h2>Mental, Emotional, Psychological</h2>
            <p>Wow. More to come.</p>

            <h2>Legal</h2>
            <p>You'll likely need some lawyers. We had some amazing ones. More to come.</p>
